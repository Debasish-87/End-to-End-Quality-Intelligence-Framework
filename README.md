# End-to-End Quality Intelligence Framework (QE 1.0)

A production-grade Quality Engineering framework that transforms automation execution into **release-level quality intelligence** using CI/CD pipelines, critical test analysis, and centralized Allure dashboards.

---

## Overview

The **End-to-End Quality Intelligence Framework** is a QE 1.0–level system designed to extend traditional automation into a **decision-driven quality platform**.

Unlike conventional frameworks that focus only on pass/fail execution, this framework provides **actionable insights** required for release readiness and risk assessment, aligned with real-world practices used in modern product organizations.

---

## Key Objective

The primary goal of this framework is to answer one critical question:

**“Is this build safe to release?”**

It achieves this by combining automated testing with quality metrics, test criticality, and CI/CD-driven visibility.

---

## 🔥 Live Quality Dashboard

📊 **Allure Dashboard (GitHub Pages)**
🔗 [https://debasish-87.github.io/End-to-End-Quality-Intelligence-Framework/](https://debasish-87.github.io/End-to-End-Quality-Intelligence-Framework/)

The dashboard is automatically generated and published after every pipeline execution, providing centralized visibility for QA, engineering, and stakeholders.

---

## What Makes This a Quality Intelligence Framework

Traditional automation answers:

> Did the tests pass?

This framework answers:

> What is the release risk?

Core intelligence capabilities include:

* Smoke vs Regression confidence separation
* Critical test impact awareness
* Severity-driven risk visibility
* CI/CD-integrated release readiness reporting

## Core Capabilities

### Test Automation Coverage

| Layer               | Technology         |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| UI Automation       | Selenium WebDriver |
| API Automation      | RestAssured        |
| Database Validation | MySQL              |
| Test Runner         | TestNG             |
| Language            | Java 17            |

---

### Suite-Based Execution Strategy

| Suite      | Purpose                           | Typical Usage     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Smoke      | Fast validation of critical paths | Pull requests     |
| Regression | Full functional coverage          | Nightly / release |
| Critical   | Business-blocking scenarios       | Release gating    |

Suite control is managed through:

* `smoke.xml`
* `regression.xml`
* TestNG groups (`Smoke`, `Regression`, `Critical`)

---

### Quality Metrics Engine

The framework computes and exposes:

* Total tests executed
* Pass and fail percentages
* Critical test failures
* Suite-level execution confidence
* Historical trend readiness via Allure

These metrics enable **data-driven quality discussions** instead of subjective assessments.

---

### Release Decision Engine

The decision engine consolidates execution data into release-oriented outcomes such as:

```
SMOKE SUITE     : PASS
REGRESSION     : 95%
CRITICAL FAILS : 1

FINAL DECISION : HOLD RELEASE
```

This mirrors the release review process followed in real engineering organizations.

## Test Execution

Run all tests:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

Run smoke suite:

```bash
mvn clean test "-DsuiteXmlFile=smoke.xml"
```

Run regression suite:

```bash
mvn clean test "-DsuiteXmlFile=regression.xml"
```

Headless execution for CI:

```bash
mvn clean test -Dheadless=true
```

---

## Reporting

Local report:

```bash
mvn allure:serve
```

CI/CD reporting:

* Reports generated after test execution
* Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages
* Centralized and versioned visibility

---

## CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions pipeline:

* Executes tests on every push
* Generates Allure reports
* Publishes reports to GitHub Pages

Workflow configuration:

```
.github/workflows/allure-deploy.yml
```

## How to Explain This Project in an Interview

“I designed a Quality Intelligence Framework that integrates UI, API, and database automation with CI/CD pipelines. It goes beyond execution by analyzing critical test failures and producing release-level quality visibility through centralized dashboards.”

This demonstrates **Quality Engineering ownership**, not just automation skills.

---

## Intended Audience

This framework reflects quality practices used in:

* Product-based engineering teams
* SaaS organizations
* CI/CD-driven delivery models

It is designed for engineers focused on:

* Release confidence
* Risk-based testing
* Scalable automation
* Stakeholder visibility
